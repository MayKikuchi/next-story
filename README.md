● Project Description: Write 3-5 sentences on your project topic. (try to address all points below)
    ○Who is it for?
    ○What will it do? (What "human activity" will it support?)
    ○What type of data will it store?
    ○What will users be able to do with this data?
    ○What is some additional functionality you can add/remove based on time constraints?

● Project task requirements:
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;    ○3-5 minimal requirements (will definitely complete)
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     ■     Users should be able to register for, log in to & log out of a regular user/admin account and have/be able to update a profile
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     ■     Users should be able to search & filter books & movies of interest
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     ■     Users should be able to see a Home page (see 2-5 smaller requirements)
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     ■     Each book/movie should have a media page that displays more details about it
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     ■     Admins should be able to add new book/movie manually
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;    ○3-7 "standard" requirements (will most likely complete)
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     ■     The website should be able to update its book/movie list via external API endpoints
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     ■     Allow (regular?) users to add a review & ratings (out of 5 starts) for a book/movie
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     ■    Users should be able to add a book or movie to a personal 'Watch later' list
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;    ○2-3 stretch requirements (plan to complete 1!)
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     ■    Each book/movie should have a button that adds it to the user's watch/read later list (edited)
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     ■    locate a theater showing chosen movies
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     ■   Users should be able to see information of ‘friends’ on the app

● Pick 2 of your minimal requirements and break each of them down into ~2-5 smaller tasks!
